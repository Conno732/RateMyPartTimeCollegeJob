## Inspiration
Searching a new job is intimidating as a college student. Often the experience at a job can differ from the employer description, and the level of pay for internships & part time work is hard to find. What if you could gain insight into other student's experiences at a job posting? Rate My University Job fulfills that role by providing a forum space designed around these issues.
## What it does
Rate My University Job is a job postings website created for college students. To access the website, a user must first create an account using a .edu email address. Users can search for job postings based on tags or the job title. The search results are filter are filtered by .edu domain name for users from the same University. A job posting contains information like the average pay reviewers received at the job, the location, a description, an average rating out of 5 stars. If a job posting doesn't exist for their position, they can create a new posting and provide the title, description, location, and a tag. 

## How we built it
To create the base website, we used HTML and CSS, using JavaScript to update and query the database. The database for the job postings, reviews, users, and authentification was FireBase. We heavily relied on JavaScript to add interactivity to the website. 
## Challenges we ran into
1. Footer implementation
2. Developing a schema and using a database
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Being able to store account data of multiple users and authenticate the .edu domain.
2. Completing a first project in a collaborative environment
3. Curating a list of job postings from the same university email domains.
4. A robust search engine based on titles and search tags.
## What we learned
In general, we learned how to format and beatify HTML files with CSS, in addition to connnecting a HTML. We learned how to use the FireStore database and how to query, upload, and update data.
## What's next for Rate My University Job
With more time and effort, along with increased knowledge of HTML and FireBase, the search features of the project could be enhanced along with the addition of animations to provide better UX.
